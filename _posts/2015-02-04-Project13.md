Askii is a combined mobile web page and SMS system that allows adult learners to study for a certification exam while on their commute. When a learner has a spare 5 minutes, they can simply text Askii to begin their customized lesson. Askii will respond with a customized set of questions and links to content that learners can study from on the go.

Askii is designed to incorporate study skills.

It tracks the questions a learner struggles with, and presents them in a review if the learner has time.
It presents questions upfront, then asks a learner to look through a few sentences of content for the answer.
As some adult learners do not have access to smart phones, Askii has been designed to be both smart phone and feature phone compatible. Any phone with access to basic Internet browsing will be able to use Askii.

The first prototype was just completed in March 2015.
