<h3> About </h3>
<p> 
I am grad student in the MIT Media Lab's <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">Lifelong Kindergarten Group</a> and an alum of <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin College of Engineering</a>. Previously, I worked part-time at MIT Lincoln Labs in the <a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/HLT/HLT.html">Human Language Technology Group</a> and was a Technical Associate at <a href="http://startupinstitute.com">Startup Institute Boston</a>. Before moving to Boston, I had lived my entire life in Reston, Virginia, one of the first socially-engineered towns in the US, and spent (almost) all my time on the soccer field. 
<br><br>I am interested in using natural language processing and computer science to build educational experiences that help people learn about themselves, their communities, and the world around them.
